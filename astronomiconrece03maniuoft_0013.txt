ASTRONOMICON III ix

the sors Fortunae in Aquarius as before. Scaliger however is bent
on picking a quai-rel with Manilius, and the quarrel he picks is this :
he says that the nocturnal method yields the same result which would
be yielded by the diurnal, and that the two are really one : ‘ quid
enim interest distantiam Solis a Luna per signa consequentia
sumptam ab horoscopo in consequentia numerare, aut distantiam
Lunae a Sole per antecedentia ab horoscopo in antecedentia quoque
putare 2 ' (ed. an. 1655 p. 199). Let us see. Apply the nocturnal
method, as expounded by Scaliger himself, to the diurnal geniture
given in my first figure. Count backwards from the Moon in Virgo
to the Sun in Cancer: that is 2 signs. Measure 2 signs backwards
from the horoscope in Libra, and where will the sors Fortunae be ’ἰ
In Sagittarius as before 2 No, in Leo. The only two cases in which
the diurnal and nocturnal methods can possibly yield the same result
are when the Sun and Moon are in the same place and when they are
in diametrical opposition. Scaliger has made a gross miscalculation‚
and his quarrel with Manilius is that Manilius has made none.

Pingre too is resolved that Manilius shall be in the wrong, but to
gain his end he is obliged to put a gloss of his own on the words
Manilius has used. uerte uias, according to Pingre, means that the
counting of degrees between Moon and Sun is to proceed forward,
just as in the diurnal geniture, but that the measurement of degrees
from the horoscope is to proceed backward: then of course the
result reached will be the same as that given by the diurnal method.
This attempt to wrest the words out of their sense is repeated by
Breiter, who assists our calculations by figuring a nocturnal geniture,
tafel 11 4, in which the sun is high overhead and the hour is about
ten o'clock in the morning ι the 12 athla, in not unnatural consterna-
tion, have hereupon abandoned the order which Manilius in verse
168 declares to be immutable, and are chasing each other round the
circle hind-before. No stranger night-scene was ever witnessed by
Walrus or by Carpenter.

Manilius has expressed his meaning so clearly and carefully that
even Scaliger's misinterpretation is inexcusable and Pingre’s might
almost be set down to malice. uerte uias says the poet, and instantly
adds sicut naturae uertitur ordo. Now in what respect does nature
invert her order at night 2 Does the sky cease turning from east to
west and begin' turning from west to east? Do the planets cease
moving from west to east and begin moving from east to west?
They do not ; and consequently Manilius’ precept cannot mean that
the nocturnal counting of degrees or measurement of distances
