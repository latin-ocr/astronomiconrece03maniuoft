ASTRONOMICON III xxi

reason: because in the space 01 every natural hour, long or short,
summer or winter, there ascend above the horizon 15 degrees 01
the zodiac. The truth is that in the space, not 01 a natural but
01 an equinoctial hour, there ascend, not 15 degrees 01 the zodiac,
but 15 degrees, or as Manilius would call them 30 stades, 01 the
equator. But to proceed: to the number obtained by this multi-
plication add the number 01 degrees which the 81111 1135 already
traversed in the sign where he is situate, and then, beginning with
that sign and proceeding leftwards, distribute the total through
the zodiac, giving 30 to each sign. In the sign where the number
ends, and the degree at which it ends, will be found the horoscope.
Such is the rule 101 daytime: 11 the birth falls by night, the rule
must be modified as follows—Here, as Jacob saw, there is a gap
in the text: what that gap contained, neither Jacob nor anyone
else has seen3 but it was this—In noting the hour, reckon its
number 110111 sunset, not from sunrise. Instead 01 taking the
position 01 the 81111, take the point 01 the zodiac diametrically opposite
to the 81111. Τ11011 perform the same operations as for finding a
diurna] horoscope, and the nocturnal horoscope will be found.

Alas, alas 1 This alternative method 01 yours, my poor Marcus,
is none other than the vulgar method which in 218-24 you said
you knew, and which in 225-46 you exposed as false. The wolf,
to whom in his proper shape you denied admittance, has come
back disguised as your mother the goose, and her gosling has opened
the door to him. To assume that 15 degrees 01 the zodiac rise in
the course 01 each natural hour 01 the day is the same thing as
to assume that each sign (or 30 degrees 01 the zodiac) takes two
natural hours to rise. The one new process here prescribed,-
to add the degrees which the 81111 1135 traversed in his sign, and
to begin the distribution 01 the total 110111 the beginning 01 the sign
and not from the degree occupied by the Sun,—is a device which
facilitates calculation3 but the method remains the same and
the result is still inevitably wrong.

How to do what Manilius is here trying to clm—elicit. the horoscope from
the ὥρα καιρική, the natural hour 01 the day, at which the birth took place,—
we are told by Ptolemy synt. 11 9 Heib. pp. 143 sq. and again op. min. pp. 163-4.
Multiply the number 01 the hour by the number of degrees of the equator
which, 011 that day 01 the year in that latitude, ascend in the space of one
ὥρα καιρική. The product will be the number of degrees of the equator
which have ascended between sunrise and the birth. Then, starting from
the place of the 81111, measure off leftward along the zodiac so many zodiacal
degrees as, from the tables provided, we know to have risen simultaneously
