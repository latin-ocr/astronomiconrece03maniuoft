ASTRONOMICON III xi

thought those whom Ptolemy’s scholiast calls οἱ ἐπιγενόμενοιε they therefore
understood ἀνάπαλιν to signify nothing but the substitution οἱ Moon for Sun
as starting point3 the counting and measuring along the zodiac, by night as
by day, was to be made forwards, Aries Taurus Gemini. That this is what
Manilius teaches I have already shown: and Greek astrologers other than
Ptolemy either say the same or say nothing to the contrary. Paul. Alex. K 2
πρῶτοσ ὀ τῆσ Τύχησ κλῆροσ, ὃν ἀριθμεῖν δεήσει, τῶν μὲν ὴμέρασ γινομένων, ἀπὸ
τῆσ ὴλιακῆσ μοίρασ ἕωσ τῆσ σεληνιακῆσ, καὶ τὸν συναχθέντα ἀριθμὸν διεκβάλλειν
ἀπὸ τῆσ ὡροσκόπου μοιρικῆσ ἀριθμήσεωσ, διδόντασ ἑκάστῳ ζῳδίῳ μοίρασ λ’· καὶ
ὅπου ἂν καταντήσῃ ὀ συναχθεὶσ ἀριθμὸσ, ἐκεῖσε τὸν τῆσ Τύχησ λέγε κλῆρον εἶναι.
τῶν δὲ νυκτὸσ, τὸ ἀνάπαλιν, τουτέστιν ἀπὸ τῆσ σεληνιακῆσ ἐπὶ τὴν
ὴλιακήν· τὰ, δὲ λοιπὰ ὁμοίωσ ἀπὸ τῆσ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου μοίρασ διέκβαλλε. In
K4 he gives a ὑπόδειγμα and repeats his injunction to reckon ἐπὶ ἡμερινῶν
γενέσεων ἀπὸ μοίρασ Ἠλίου ἐ’ωσ μοίρασ Σελήνησ· . . . καὶ οὕτωσ τὸν συναγόμενον
ἀριθμὸν διέκβαλλε ἀπὸ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου, to which in L there is added a note
that in both operations the order of the signs is to be followed, ὼσ γὰρ

ὡροσκόπουε on the same page he has καὶ ἐπὶ μὲν ἡμερινῆσ γενέσεωσ οὕτωσ*
ἐπὶ δὲ νυκτερινῆσ ἀνάπαλιν. οἷον ἐπὶ τοῦ κλήρου τῆσ Τύχησ ἐλάβομεν ἐπὶ

τὰ ἴσα ὁμοίωσ ἀπὸ ὡροσκόπου. Firmicus math. 1v 17 l is likewise in
agreement with Manilius so far as he there commits himself: in omni
(lenitura nocturna computa a Luna usque ad Solem, in diurna yenicura
a Sole computa rursus ad Lunam, et, quantuscumque siqnorum fuerit
‚lumem-3, ίαηεα ab horoscopo incipiens siqua numerem ec, quodque siynum
habuerit nouissimum numerum, ipsum tibi ‚sianum locum Fortunae demon-
strat: but in 3-4 he is more explicit and less intelligible‚ and agrees
neither with Manilius nor with anyone else. He says that by day the degi-ees
should be counted from the Sun to the Moon, but whether forwards or back-
wards he does not tell us ; they should then be measured off from the horoscope
in dexteram partem, which means ἐπὶ τὰ ἡγούμενα, contradicts both Paulus and
Ptolemy, and seems to be a slip of the pen. By night, he proceedS, they should
be counted from the Moon to the Suu per siqua sequentia (ἐπὶ τὰ ἑπόμενα)
simili modo, which implies that they are thus counted also by day ; they should
then be measured off from the horoscope, but in which direction he leaves us to
find out for ourselves.

There is yet another vagary to be met with in Vett. Val. p. 155 5-9 ἐμοὶ δ’
ἔδοξεν ἐπὶ μὲν ἡμερινῆσ γενέσεωσ λαμβάνειν ἀπὸ Ἠλίου ἐπὶ Σελήνην καὶ τὰ ἴσα
ἀπό ὼροσκόπου, ἐπὶ δὲ νυκτερινῆσ, ἐφ’ ὅσον μὲν ὴ Σελήνη ὑπέργειόσ ἐστι, τουτέστι

203-246 The place of the sors Fortunae, and consequently of all

the 12 atkla, depends, as we have seen, upon the place of
the horoscope. But how is the place of the horoscope itself to be
ascertained 2 Direct observation at the instant of birth, which Sextus
