and they are enumerated by Manilius in an order which corresponds
to their geometrical arrangement :

Horoscope: 78
[Medium Caelum: 77
‘[Occide11t: 75

Imum Caelum: 72
f Superior trigon of Hor. : 68
[Inferior trigon of Hor. : 63

s Superior hexagon of Hor. ε 57
Πηὶθϊίοι· hexagon of Hor. : 50
f Inferior dodecagon of Hor. : 42
[Superior dodecagon of Hor. ε 23
J Superior dodecagon of Occ. : 33
[Inferior dodecagon of Occ. ε 12

That this order may at the same time be as nearly as possible a
descending order of magnitude, Manilius has placed the inferior
dodecagon of the horoscope before the superior: to have also
placed the superior dodecagon of the occident before that of the
horoscope would have deranged the geometrical order too much.
