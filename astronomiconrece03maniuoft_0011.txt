11-‘28 and p. 168 19-25. Many other κλῆροι, such as κλῆροσ κλοπῆσ, δάνουσ
οι· δανείων, ἔχθρασ· 01· ἐχθρῶν, ξένησ or ξενιτεὶασ, are mentioned in C.C.A.G.
1 pp. 169 sq. and by Vettius Valens.

160-202 We are now to learn the proper method of applying the

circle of athla to the circle of zodiacal signs. Since the
order of the 12 atkla in their circle is unchangeable‚ it suffices us to
know the right place in the zodiac for the first of them, the sors
Fortunae: the rest will then fall into position automatically. The
rules for placing the sors Fortunae are the following. Ascertain the
posture of the zodiac and the planets at the moment of nativity,
and then, according as the nativity fell by day or by night, proceed
by the one or the other of two methods. If it fell by day, count the
number of degrees from the place of the sun to the place of the
Moon, and measure off this number along the zodiac from the cardinal
point of the horoscope or ascendant : where the number ends, there
will be found the sors Fortunae, just as far removed from the horo-
scope as the Moon from the Sun. For example : let the Sun be in
Cancer, the Moon in Virgo, and the horoscope in Libra. The Sun
and Moon are 2 signs apart (for clearness and simplicity Ι reckon by
whole signs and not by degrees) 3 measure off 2 signs from Libra, and
the sors Fortunae will be found in Sagittarius. The other athla will
then follow it, as Manilius says at 85 and 174, in the order of the
signs 3 the second in Capricorn, the third in Aquarius, and 1116 twelfth
in Scorpius.
