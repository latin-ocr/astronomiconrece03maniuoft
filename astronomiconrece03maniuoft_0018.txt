xiv M. MANILII

and severally set in 2 1101113 and 40 minutes. Taurus and Aquarius
rise in 1 h. 36 m. and set in 2 h. 24 m. Gemini and Capricorn rise in
1 h. 52 m. and set in 2 h. 8 111. Cancer and Sagittarius rise in 2 h. 8 m.
and set in 1 h. 52 111. Leo and Scorpius rise in 2 11. 24 m. and set in
1 11. 36 m. Virgo and Libra rise in 2 h. 40 m. and set in 1 h. 20 m.
Thus each sign's time of rising added to its time of setting yields
4 hours ; and 3ο does each sign's time of rising (or setting) added to
the opposite sign’s time of setting (or rising). The two signs adjacent
to the point of the verna] equinox rise quickest and set slowest:
those adjacent to the autumna] equinox 1130 slowest and set quickest.

But beside this table of hours there is a table of stades. And
what is a stade ’ἔ Manilius has forgotten to tell us 3 and though at
ΠΙ 418 he has tried to give the total number of stades, the scribes
have stepped between and the number is not there. Neither Scaliger
nor Salmasius nor I can cite any place where the term is used as
Manilius uses it (for in Firm. Vin 4 16 it means something utterly
different), and the lexicons do not even cite the use of Manilius.
The meaning however can easily be learnt from the context. Scaliger,
who afterwards wandered off into a wilderness of error, said in his
first edition at verse 282 ⁶ stadium est dimidium gradus '. True so
far : a stade is half a degree 3 but half a degree of what 2 Scaliger
knew, but forgot to say, and consequently no other commentator
knows. Fayus and Stoeber say it is half a degree of the zodiac;
Pingre says it 13 011 arc of the ecliptic which takes 2 minutes to rise
or set3 and Breiter says it is both. Both it cannot be, and it is
neither. Half a degree of the zodiac occupies no constant time in
rising, and an arc of the ecliptic which takes 2 minutes to rise has no
constant length. To employ either the one or the other would intro-
duce anew into the calculation of ascensions that very element of
fiuctuation and indeterminateness which Manilius is engaged in
expelling.

A stade 13 half a degree of the equator ; it is an arc of the equator
which takes 2 minutes to rise. The equator throughout all its length,
unlike the zodiac and ecliptic, makes the same angle with the horizon,
and consequently equal arcs of the equator rise in equal times ; 15
degrees or 30 stades in every equinoctial hour. The whole circle of
360 degrees or 720 stades is therefore equivalent to the whole circle
of 24 hours ε so much so that the Greek astronomers use the term
χρόνοι ἷσημεριιιοί to signify degrees of the equator; and when
Manilius appends his table of stades to his table of hours he is only
saying the same thing over again. He was nothing loth : the more
