ASTRONOMICON III xv

arithmetic the merrier. But to reckon by stades was easier than to
reckon by hours because it avoided the use of fractions ζ and Ptolemy
synt. Π 8 for the same reason states the ascensions of the signs not
in hours but in degrees of the equator.

Manilius’ table of the stades which, in the latitude now under

consideration, rise and set simultaneously with the several signs of the
zodiac is the following. With Aries and Pisces severally there rise

40 stades and there set 80 ; with Taurus and Aquarius there rise 48
and there set 72 3 with Gemini and Capricorn there rise 56 and there
set 64 3 with Cancer and Sagittarius there rise 64 and there set 56 3
with Leo and Scorpius there rise 72 and there set 48 3 with Virgo and
Libra there rise 80 and there set 40.

The complete table of hours and stades sor the rising and the
setting of the. signs is therefore this :

It will be seen that each interval consists of 8 stades or 16
minutes.

Valens p. 23 sq.‚ without specifying the latitude of which he speaks, gives
an. account of the aseensions which is identical with Manilius’, though using
degrees of the equator instead of stades: Aries Pisces 20‘2'1aurus Aquarius
240, Gemini capricorn )80, Cancer Sagittarius‘* 02 ⁰,Leo Scorpius 360, Virgo
Libra 40. Firmicus 11 ll 3, if his astrological jargon is translated into
astronomical equivalents, will be found to give the same table of degi-ees,
assigning it, like Manilius, to the latitude not of Rhodes but of Alexandria
(and, says hc, of Babylon). Martianus Capella 844-5, not specifying his
latitude, gives a very similar table of hours, in which the shortest time
(Aries Pisces lh. 20 m.) and the longest (Virgo Libra 211. 40 m.) coincide
with Manilius’ account, but the inter-vals differ from his, in that some of
them consist of more than 16 m. and some of less. The conventional table
of hours and degrees for the latitude of Alexandria is given by Paulus
Alexandrinus A 2-4 and B 2 : Aries and Pisces severally rise in 1 h. 26 m. 40 s.
and with 210 40' of the equat-or3 at each stage the hours are augmented by
13 m. 20 s. and the degrees by 3⁰ 20¹, till Virgo and Libra rise in 211. 33 m.
20 s. and with 380 20’. The same figures glimmer through the corruption of
the text at Porph. isag. p. 195 in a table for the latitude of Alexandria which
is ascribed by Porphyry to the more ancient astrologers in general and by
comm. Ptol. tetr. p. 41 to the Egyptians
