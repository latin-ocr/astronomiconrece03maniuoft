xxvi M. MANILII

γη κατ’ Αἰγυπτίουσ ἐν τῷ δι’ Ἀλεξανδρείασ κλίματι ε’τῶν λε’· μερίζω τὰ λε’
ἔτη εἰσ τὰσ λ’ μοίρασ τοῦ γη καὶ τοῦ ι’σαναφόρου τούτου, λέγω δὴ τοῦ ςῑ. εὑρίσκω
τὴν μοῖραν τοῦ γη καὶ τοῦ §L μηνῶν ιδ’.

Firmicus in math. 11 ll ignores, like Manilius, the τεταρτημόριον or doctrine
of three signs, and professes to declare quoto αηηο ‘conumquodque siquam in
yenicuris oriatur, by which he means ‘quoto aequatoris gradu ortus unius-
cuiusque signi absoluatur', ‘quot aequatoris gradibus (qui singuli singulos
uitae annos tribuunt) unumquodque signum oriatur ’. He gives the numbers
for seven different latitudes, and he begins, making the same mistake as
Manilius 111 275-300, in climate . . . Alexandriae (he should say Rhodi) Aries
oritur anno XX, Taurus XXIV, Gemini XXVIII, Cancer XXXII, Leo XXXVI,
Virqo XL, Libra similiter XI„ Scorpius XXXVI, Saqitcarius XXXII, Capri-
cornus XXVIII, Aquarius XXIV, Pisces XX. Divide these numbers by 2
and they yield the numbers of Manil. ΙΙΙ 567-580, except that Manilius
adds 8 months to each.

But when in Valens p. 164 we find a chapter, 1v 6, headed πόσα ἔτη
μερίζει ἕκαστον ζῴδιον, its contents are very different. We read μερίζει ὁ
μὲν ’Τδροχόοσ ἔτη λ’, ὁ Αἰγόκερωσ κζ’, but we leam as we proceed that these
numbers have nothing to do with the ascension of the signs or with any
astronomical fact, but are based 011 fantasies about the planets and. their
houses in the zodiac. It is said by Porphyry isag. p. 195 that the things
ἀναγκαιότατα εἰσ τὴν εὕρεσιν τῶν τῆσ ς’·ωῆσ χρόνων are two, ἥ τε τῶν ὁρίων
τοῖσ ε’ πλανωμένοισ διανέμησισ, ἥ τε τῶν ἀναφορικῶν χρόνων τῶν ζῳδίων; but,
as in most departments of astrology, the signs were superseded by the
planets,—schola rursus Aesculapi secuta, as Pliny says, quae stata uitae
spatia a stellis accipi dicia—and in Ptolemy and most of the extant astrologers
it is the planets that chiefly determine the length of life.

Not the signs only but also the 12 temples of the dode-
catropos, enumerated and described in Π 856-967, Δ0011-
tribute their tale of years to the sum. This lore is peculiar to
Manilius, who here vouchsafes to tell us how many years each
temple contributes under the most favourable conditions, when
ffiefflwffisaeefflfflmmfflyfflwffl:tmcmmffoffflQQQy
interferenoe he reserves for that part of his poem which is lost or*
was never written. The temple which is the giver of years is that
in which the Moon is situate at the nativity; and the terms of
life severally bestowed by the 12 temples compose the following
scheme. The lowest number of years is 12 : add 11 (=12 -1) and
you have the next lowest, 233 to this add 10 (ΞΠ-1) and you
have the third, 33 ; add 9 (= 10- 1) and you have 42 3 add 8 (--9 - 1)
and you have 50 ; add 7 (=8— 1) and you have 57 3 add 6 (=7— 1)
andymimwe633add5(=6—1)mffl0muhmoe68;add4(=5-1)
and you have 72 ; add 3 (=4- 1) and you have 75 ; add 2 (=3- 1)
and you have 77; add 1 (=2-1) and you have 78. The sums
are a regularly ascending series, where each succeeding number is

581-617
