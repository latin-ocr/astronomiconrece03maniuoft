ASTRONOMICON III xiii

during an October day ’ἐ for between the sunrise and sunset of every
day, no matter how long or short, there always rise 6 signs or 180
degrees, half: of the zodiac. If Sagittarius in October takes more
than 2 hours to rise, one at least of the other signs then rising must
take less. Ascensions therefore cannot be equal.

247-274 And indeed it is vain to base our calculation of the horo-

scope upon anything so unstable as the fluctuating hours
of the natural day. We must have a standard hour, whose length
will not alter with the season ; and twice a year we are furnished with
such an hour by nat-ure herself. At the vernal and again at the
autumnal equinox the 12 hours of day are equal to the 12 hours of
night, and each hour is ᾗ of the νυχθήμερον. The astrologer must
divide the νυχθήμερον into 24 such hours at all seasons of the year,
disregarding the times of sunrise and sunset and the duration of
light and darkness. It will then be found that at midwinter the day
contains 9} of these unvarying hours and the night 14{‚ while at
midsummer it is the day that has 141} and the night Q. Such at
least is the length of the longest and the shortest day and night in the
latitude of Alexandria or the Egyptian Delta.

Here Manilius errs. In this latitude, according to the ancient
astronomers, the longest day was of 14 hours and the shortest oi 10 ε

275—300 In this latitude, says Manilius, the ascensions of the signs

are the following (and for pure love of ciphering he gives
their descensions as well, which are no help towards finding the
horoscope). Aries and Pisces rise severally in 1 hour and 20 minutes
