43—159 We have heard already of two celestial circles‚ coincident

the one with the other, which are divided into 12 equal
parts: the zodiac (Ι 256-74, 667-83) with its 12 signs, and the
dodecatropos (Π 856-967) with its 12 temples. Here is a third, to
be superposed on the other two: the circle of the 12 athla or sortes.
Of these three circles the first, like the milky way, is a portion of the
revolving sky: the second, like the horizon and the meridian, is
incorporea] and does not spin with the heavens. The third, also
incorporeal, is neither rotatory like the first nor stationary like
the second: the astrologer carries it in his pocket, whence at the
moment of a nativity he whips it out and claps it on the zodiac.
The rules for performing this operation will be given in verses
160—202.

The 12 parts of this circle, which contain the various activities
experiences and circumstances of human life, are called by Manilius
sortes (75, 80, 96, 138), labores (160, 170), and athla (162, 172, 193,
201), a term applied by Varro and others, in the sense of ἇθλοι, to
the labours of Hercules, likewise 12 in number.

The contents of the 12 parts are assorted as follows

με

. House and home and property.
Military life and foreign travel.

Civil lise.

Law, justice, and pleading.
Marriage, friendship‚ and hospitality.
Means and prosperity.
