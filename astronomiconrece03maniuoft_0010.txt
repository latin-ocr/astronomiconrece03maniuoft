vi M. MANILII

coniunges ’ that the numeration‚ like that of the signs os the zodiao,
is from right to left.

Liars need not have long memories if they address themselves
only to fools, who have short ones ; and an astrological poet writing
his third book may safely forget his second, because an astrologioal
reader will never remember it. But the impious and a‘ctentivev
soeptio will not fail to remark that some of the goods now paoked
in these oompartments have already been stowed elsewhere. In
134 sq. uitae actus and mores are assigned to the 1οὼ athlum; but
in Π 831 arbitrium uitae and regula morum belonged to the horoscope,
which is one of the 4 cardines, The 11th athlum in 140 sq. contains
ualetudo nuno libera morbis mmo oppressa ; but in Π 901 sq. momenta
salutis and bella morborum were assigned to the 5ὼ temple os the
dodecatropos. In 132 the 9¹³¹ athlum has gnatorum sortem dubiam
patriosque timores allotted to it3 but the 1⁵t temple had fortunam
natorum and uota parentum in Π 946 sq. Wedlook is provided with
no fewer than three repositories : the western cardo in Π 839, the 10th
temple in Π 925, and now the 5ὼ athlum in ΙΠ 120. How these⁴
conflicts are to be reconoiled we never learn.

This circle of 12 sortes is nowhere else to be found 3 but the name
by which Manilius calls the first of them (96, 171, 176, 192, 201) is
a household word in astrology. The locus Fortunae or κλῆροο- Τύχησ
is a thing which has to be mentioned so often that for brevity it is
denoted by a special symbol, ΕΒ, as if it were a planet or a sign of
the zodiao. But the κλῆροι of which it is one are usually a system
of seven, oorresponding to the seven planets: Τύχη or κλῆροσ-
Σελήνησ, Δαίμων or κλῆροσ· ιΗλίου, Ἔρωο· OI‘ κλῆροο· Ἀφροδίτησ,
Ἀνάγκη or κλῆροσ- “Ερμοῦ, Τόλμα 01· κλῆροσ· ”Αρεωο·, Νίκη or
κλῆροσ Διόσ, Nep-emo· 01· κλῆροσ· Κρόνου. These do nob form a
continuous circle, like the 12 sortes of Manilius, but the place of
each is determined by separate calculation.

Paulus Alexandrinus ed. 1586 fol. ΚΞ περὶ τῶν ζ’ κλήρων τῶν ἐν τῇ
Παναρέτῳ. These he enumeratos K2-4, beginning πρῶτοα- ὁ τῆσ Τύχησ
κλῆροσ- and following the order which I have given above. His scholiam:
K4 summarises thus: ’γέ-γραπται τῷ Ἐρμῇ περὶ τῶν τοιούτων κλήρων ἐν βίβλῳ
λεγομένῃ Παναρέτῳ, ἔνθα καὶ τὰ τούτων ἀποτελέσματα παραδίδωσι. λέγει οὖν
ζ’ κλήρουσ πρὸσ τὸν ἀριθμὸν τῶν ζ’ ἀστέρων. τὸν μὲν κλῆρον τοῦ Θ, ἀγαθὸν
ὀνομάζων Δαίμονα· τὸν δὲ τῆσ (ζ, ἀγαθὴν Τύχην (Paulus himself in both cases
omits the epithet)· τὸν δὲ τοῦ u, Νίκην· τὸν δὲ τοῦ ζ, Ἀνάγκην· τὸν δὲ τῆσ
ῼ, Ἔρωτα· τὸν δὲ τοῦ (3⁴, Τὸλμαν· καὶ τὸν του ἦ, Νέμεσιν. ἰστέον δὲ ὅτι καὶ
ἄλλοι κλῆροι ὑπάρχουσιν, ἔξωθεν τῆσ ΙΙαναρέτου, πατρὸσ· καὶ μητρὸσ καὶ ἀδελφῶν
καὶ τέκνων καὶ ’γάμων καὶ ἄλλων πολλῶν· ὁ μέντοι Παῦλοσ οὗτοσ- οὑ πάντασ
ἐκτίθεται. There are similar accounts in catal. cod. astrol. Graec. 1 p. 160
