xvi M. MANILH

All methods of this sort, Manilius' among them, are rejected by Ptolemy
tetr. p. 12 no less cavalierly than Manilius himself rejects what he calls the
‘uulgata ratio' at ΙΙΙ ‘2182 τῇ κοινῇ πραγματείᾳ καὶ τῇ πρὸσ ὁμαλὰο· ὑπεροχάσ
τῶν ἀναφορῶν συνισταμένῃ, μηδὲ κατὰ μικρὸν ἐγγὺσ οὔσῃ τῆσ ἁληθεὶασ. In synt.
11 7 Heib. pp. 123 sq. Ptolemy calculates the ascensions of the signs for the
latitude of which Manilius speaks, where the longest day has 14ss hours; ancl
it appears that Manilius is wrong in every particular. Aries and Pisces rise
not with 40 stades or ‘20² but with 19⁰ 12* 3 Virgo and Libra not with 80 stades
or 40⁰ but with 36Ω 28’; Leo and Scorpius, instead of rising quicker than
Virgo and Libra, rise slower, with 37ο 2'; the increase from one sign’s
ascension to the next is never 8 stades or 4⁰, but always either less or more,
and the rate of increase is not even equable throughout all the parts of a sign.

But not only is Manilius thus at odds with astronomy : he is at odds with
himself. In verses 385-442 he professes to give a general rule by which the
ascensions may be ascertained for any latitude. Apply that general rule
to this particular case, and it will be found to give results which are not the
result-s here stated by its author. By the general rule, in a latitude where the
longest day has 14} hours, the ascension of Aries will not be 40 stades but 39&
not 1 h. ‘20 m. but 1 h. 18 m, 20 s. 3 the ascension of Libra will not be 80 stades
but 803, not 211. 40 m. but 2h. 41 m. 40 s. ; and no ascension will differ by

less than 20 seconds or ὲ of a stade from the figures given in the table above.

But it is now time to use this table for the discovery of a horo-
scope in the latitude for which it is designed, and to compare the
result With that obtained on p. xii by the disparaged and discarded
‘ uulgata ratio ⁹. Let the moment of birth, as before, be noon on
March 21. Count the equinoctial hours which have passed and
the stades of the equator which have risen since sunrise : the hours
are 6 and the stades are 180. The sun is at the 1st point of Aries :
measure off thence on the zodiac a length which shall correspond
to these figures. Aries Taurus and Gemini are together equivalent
to 144 stades or 4h. 48 m. : the residue, 36 stades or 1 h. 12 m.,
signifies so much of Cancer as rises with that portion of the equator
or in that space of time: ἐξ, between {g and ἐξ. The horoscope
therefore is in the 171¹* degree of Oancer3 and the ‘ uulgata ratio ³,
if Manilius is right, was wrong by more than half a sign.

301—384 The table of ascensions given in verses 275-300 is applicable

to the latitude in which the longest day or night is of
1432» hours and the shortest of 9}— But days and nights and the
inclination of the zodiac to the horizon are not the same all the
world over. At the terrestrial equator each sign of the zodiac
takes (roughly speaking) 2 hours to rise‚ and all the year round
the night is equal to the day. As we move northward, the zodiac‚
with the celestial equator, is tilted to the south, and day and night
