ASTRONOMICON III xvii

grow ever more and more unequaL till the southern signs one after
another touch the horizon and disappear below it, and the sun,
if he is travelling through them, is lost to sight for days and months
at a time. Lastly‚ when we reach the pole, he is invisible for half
the year continuously‚ and continuously visible for the other half,
because the signs from Aries to Virgo are always above the horizon,
and the signs from Libra to Pisces beneath it. It is clear that in
these changing circumstances our table of ascensions will no longer

correspond to the facts of nature, and may be left behind us at
Rhodes.

385—442 We want therefore a general rule which will enable us

in any latitude to determine the time occupied by a
sign in rising; and that rule is this. Count up the hours of the
longest day and divide the sum by 6 ; the quotient will be the time
occupied in rising by Leo. Count up likewise, and likewise divide
by 6, the hours of the shortest night: the quotient will be the
time occupied in rising by Taurus. Subtract the lesser of the
two quotients from the greater and divide the remainder by 3.
Add this third quotient to the rising-time of Taurus, and you
have the rising-time of Gemini3 add it again, and you have the
rising-time of Cancer ; add it a third time, and of course you have
the rising-time, already ascertained‚ of Leo. Make the same
addition to Leo’s rising-time, and you have Virgo's; and Virgo’s is
also Libra’s. From Libra’s subtract the same amount, and you
have Scorpius’ ; from Scorpius’, and you have Sagittarius' ; from
Sagittarius'‚ and you have Capricorn’s; from Capricorn's, and
you have Aquarius', which is equal to Taurus’; from Aquarius'‚
and you have Pisces', to which Aries’ is equal. A good deal of
this,—that Libra takes the same time to rise as Virgo, that Aries
takes the same time as Pisces and takes less time than Taurus,—
Manilius has left the reader to infer for himself. Such then is the
scale of hours : now for the scale of degrees or rather stades. The
phraseology of what follows is elaborately made to differ from
that which was used above, but the arithmetica] operations are
the same. The stades are 720 : from this total subtract a number
which is to 7 20 as the hours of the shortest night are to 24 ε divide
the remainder (equivalent to the longest day) by 6, and the quotient
will be the rising-time of Leo; divide the subtrahend by 6, and
the quotient will be the rising-time of Taurus. Subtract the latter
quotient from the former and divide the remainder by 3 ε add one
