ASTRONOMIOON III xix

If our instructor has an alternative rule for finding the horoscope,
and 116 has, now is the time to give it. But no: we must wait
till verse 483. First we must listen while he sets forth a method
of discovering, in any latitude, the rate at which daylight increases
between midwinter and midsummer. The information, if true,
is interesting and even, for some purposes, useful; but not for
the purpose of determining the ascension of the signs or ascertaining
the horoscope. No matter: Manilius cannot forgo the pleasure
01 dressing up more arithmetic in more figures and tropes. ‘ quod
uno uerbo potuit ⁹, says Scaliger, ‘pluribus ambagibus maluit, ad
fertilitatem ingenii ostentandam '. Inappropriate as the paragraph
is to its place, there is yet no place in the book to which it would
be less inappropriate; and in form and structure it has much
affinity with the paragraph preceding, which apparently suggested
it to its facile and frivolous author.

To discover the monthly increase of daylight between the winter
solstice and thc vernal equinox, take the number of hours by which
the shortest day is less than 12, 01 the longest night is more, and
divide it by 6: then ὲ will be the increase of daylight in the first
month after the solstice, ξ will be the further increase in the second
month, and ἐξ will be the yet further increase in the third. It
is here assumed by Manilius, as by Geminus isag. 6 42 παραύξηο-ισ

when the sun first enters the solstitia] or equinoctial signs3 so
that the three months will be those which the sun spends in
passing through Capricorn‚ Aquarius, and Pisces. In the latitude
of Rome, where the shortest day has 9 hours and the longest
night 15, the difference between either of these and the equinoctial
day or night of 12 hours is 3 hours: to Capricorn therefore will
be allotted half-an-hour‚ to Aquarius an hour, to Pisces an hour
and a half. But of course the increase will be cumulative: the
hour added by Aquarius to the half-hour of Capricorn will make
the day an hour and a half longer than at midwinter‚ and the
hour and a half superadded by Pisces will make it three
hours longer than at midwinter and will raise its sum of
hours to 12.. To this number Aries will add as much as Pisces
added, and raise it to 13} 3 Taurus will add as much as Aquarius,
and raise it to 14} 3 Gemini as much as capricorn, and raise it to
15 hours. Thence it will descend by corresponding stages from
Cancer to Sagittarius. The increase or decrease is least in the
