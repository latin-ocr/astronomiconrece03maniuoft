xviii M. MANILII

third to Taurus' rising-time, and you have Gemini’s : thenceforward
continue the whole process as in the case of the hours. You will
then know how many hours and how many stades to assign to
the rising of each sign in any latitude, and you will be able to perform,
with certainty of a true result, the operati ons for finding the horoscope
which have been described in verses 221-4.

The rule is more simply if less fully given in C.C.A.(÷. 1 p. 163 6-14 ἐν τῷ
τρίτῳ κλίματι (1.0. Ἀλεξανδρείασ), ἐπειδὴ ὁ με’·γιστοσ αὐτοῦ χρόνοσ, τουτέστιν ἀπὸ
Καρκίνου ἐ’ωσ Τοξότου, ’γίνονται ἔτη σι’ (Le. 210⁰ of the equabor)‚ καὶ ὁ ἐλάχιστοσ
αὑτοῦ χρόνοσ ἐστὶν ἀπὸ Αἰγοκέρωτοσ ἐ’ωσ Διδύμων ἔτη ρν’, ταῦτα οὖν ἐὰν μερίσω
παρὰ τὸν ιε’, οἵ εἰσιν ὡριαΐοι χρόνοι ἰσημερινοὶ, ἐστὶν ἡ μεγίστη ἡμέρα ὡρῶν ιδ’
ἰσημερινῶν, ἡ δὲ ἐλαχίστη ι’σημερινῶν ι’. ληψόμεθα οὖν ἑκάστου χρόνου, τοῦ μεγίστου
καὶ ἐλαχίστου, τὸ ἕκτον· ’γίνεται οὖν τοῦ μεγίστου χρόνου, τῶν σι’, τὸ ἕκτον λε’,
τοῦ δὲ ἐλαχίστου κε’· καταλείπονται οὖν λοιπὰ ι’· τούτων τὸ τρίτον ’γίνεται
γ’γ’, ὅ ἐστιν αὑξομείωσισ ἑκάστου ζῳδίου. τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων
κλιμάτων γνώσει. Valens p. 24 5-8 has a similar precept, ἔστω τὸν Λέοντα
ἀναφέρεσθαι ἐν λς”, ὁμοίωσ δὲ καὶ Σκορπίον, τὸν δὲ Ταῦρον καὶ τὸν Ὕδροχόον ἐν
κδ’· λοιπὰ ιβ’, ὧν τὸ τρίτον δ’· αὕτη προσθαφαίρεσισ (this word, whatever the
lexicographers may say, means πρόσθεσισ καὶ ἀφαίρεσισ, much as αὐξομείωσισ
means αὔξησισ καὶ μείωσισ). οὕτωσ καὶ καθ’ ἕκαστον κλίμα ζητῶν ἐπιὙνώσῃ. 011
the preceding page he has given another rule which comes to the same thing:
subtract the ascension of Aries (not Taurus) from the ascension of Libra (not

Leo) and divide the remaindex· by 5 instead of 3.

Ι have already observed that Manilius here contradicts what
he said in verses 275-300. Let the general rule which he now
prescribes be applied to the particular case which he there
professed to deal with‚—a latitude in which the longest day is
14-12— hours and the shortest night 9{,—and we shall have a table
os hours and stades which is other than the table there given.

I have also observed already that neither of Manilius’ two cal·
culations agrees with Ptolemy’s or with the truth.

443—482 We have thus been put in possession of a rule enabling
us, in any latitude, to determine the time occupied by
each sign in rising, and so to ascertain the place of the horoscope.
