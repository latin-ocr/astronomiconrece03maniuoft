xii M. MANILII

Empiricus πρὸο- ἀστρ. 50-85 pronounces impossible, is allowed by
Manilius to be extremely difficult, though of the many difficulties
enumerated by Sextus he mentions only one, the velocity with which
the heaven revolves. There is indeed in common use, he says, a
calculation which professes to surmount this obstacle. Note (by the
sundial or otherwise) the moment of birth, count the time which at
that moment has elapsed since sunrise‚ and translate this time into
degrees of the zodiac at the rate of 1 sign (30 degrees) to every 2
hours: hours, that is, of the natural day, each of which is ᾖ of the
time between sunrise and sunset. Measure off this number of degrees
along the zodiac, starting from the point occupied by the Sun and
proceeding in the order of the signs, that is leftward, eastward,
counterclockwise. The point of the zodiac where the number ter-
minates will be that which was rising at the moment of birth. For
example : let the moment of birth be noon on March 21. That is the
end of the fin] hour after sunrise, and 6 hours are equivalent to 3
signs. The sun is at the lSt point of Aries : measure off thence on the
zodiac the 3 signs Aries Taurus and Gemini, and the horoscope will
be found at the 1St point of the next sign Cancer.

This method is based on the assumption that every sign of the
zodiac occupies in rising 2 hours of the natural day, ὲ of the time
between sunrise and sunset. But that assumption is false. The
zodiac is oblique, and consequently different signs make different
angles with the eastern horizon. Taurus for example rises at an
inclination nearer the horizontal than Cancer's, Virgo at an inclina·
tion nearer the perpendicular 3 the 30 degrees of Taurus therefore
take less time to rise than the 30 degrees of Cancer, the 30 degrees
of Virgo take more. Now on a day of the year, say April l, which
embraces between sunrise and sunset the risings both of Taurus
and of Virgo, if Taurus takes 2 hours to rise, Virgo must take more ;
if Virgo takes 2 hours, Taurus must take less. And the fact is that
neither takes 2 hours.

But not only is the assumption of equal ascensions false: it is
also sels-contradictory. An hour, 5¹5 of the natural day, is not of the
same length all the year round ε it is long when the days are long and
short when they are short. If then a sign occupies in rising 2 of the
long hours of a summer’s day, it must occupy more than 2 of the
shorter hours of a day in spring or autumn or winter. Sagittarius
for instance rises between sunrise and sunset both in July and in
October, and if it takes 2 J uly hours to rise‚ it must take more than
2 October hours. And what of the other 5 signs which also rise
