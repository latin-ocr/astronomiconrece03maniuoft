xxviii M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON III

The MSS give 61 inst-ead of 72 in verse 598, but the change of n to s obtains
the number required by the scheme.

The MSS give 150 instead of 50 in verse 607, but the change of tto p obtains
the number required by the scheme.

The scheme requires no other conjectural alteration of numerals. But the
following numbers are ambiguously stated ε

’Π (might be 75) in verse 594.
75 (might be 76) in verse 596.
57 (might be 117) in verse 605.
33 (might be 36) in verse 615.

The two temples, VI and X11, which allot the fewest years, are
those which Hephaestio Ι 12 calls κάκιστοι and Firmicus Π 17
nouissima. If Manilius has weighed his words in what he says
oi these two at 613 and 616 sq„ they not merely contribute few
years of their own but forbid any further contribution of years by
the zodiacal signs or any other donor.

618-682 There follow some sixty verses which pretend to set forth

the importance of the four tropieal signs ; but it is only
a pretence: their true purpose is to ornament the end of the book
with vignettes of the four seasons. Such astronomy as they contain
is both vague and elementary, and of astrology they contain next
to nothing.
