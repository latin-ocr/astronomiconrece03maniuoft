xxiv M. MANILII

the quotient to Leo, so he now divides by 6 the years os the longest
life (112 according to Epigenes, as we shall read below) and gives
to Leo the quotient 18 years 8 months. As he then divided by 6
the hours of the shortest night and gave the quotient to Taurus,
so he now divides by 6 the sum of 76 years (how obtained I do not
know, though Scaliger ed. 3 p. 263 pretends to fetch an explanation
from Persia) and gives to Taurus the quotient 12 years 8 months.
And by pursuing the calculation with the same fidelity to his
own precedent he arrives at the figures which Ι have tabulated
above.

To what persons, and under what conditions, do these signs
allot these portions of lifete Manilius does not say, but one naturally
assumes that it is the sign occupying the horoscope which confers
the gift on the child born beneath it. The horoscope is called
ζωῆσ ὃοτήρ and ὖπόστασισ τῶν χρόνων; the determination Of the
horoscope, as Manilius has explained at great length, depends upon
the ascensions of the signs, and these are alleged by Porphyry
isag. p. 195 as the reasons why the Chaldaeans, like Epigenes and
Manilius, hoped to ascertain from those same ascensions the duration
Of human life: ἐξηγησόμεθα τοίνυν ὅ τι ποτὲ βούλεται αὐτοῖσ- τό ἐκ
τῶν ἀναφορῶν τὰ ἔτη πειρᾶσθαι τὰ βιώσιμα ἀνευρίσκειν ἐπὶ τῶν
γεννωμένων. τῆσ γὰρ ὡροσκοπούσησ μοίρασ οὐκ ἄλλοθεν μάλιστα
εὑρισκομένησ ἢ ἐκ τῶν ἀναφορικῶν χρόνων, καὶ τῆσ ζωῆσ δὲ ἑκάστου
ὃοκούσησ αὐτοῖο· ἀπὸ τοῦ κατὰ τὸν ὡροσκόπον σημείου ἐνδίδοσθαι,
εἷκότωσ οὖν καὶ τὰ τοῦ σύμπαντοσ βίου μεγέθη χρονικὰ τῆσ ζωῆσ
ἀπὸ τῶν ἅναφορῶν λαμβάνειν ἔκριναν.

It is clear, since some of us die even before we are ten years
old, that the gift is not absolute, and may be abridged or cancelled
by some thwarting influence, what the Greeks call an ἀναιρὲτησ·;
but Manilius says nothing of this. It is also clear, since some of
us live even after we are twenty-one, that the gift is only a portion,
and that other portions are bestowed upon us by other givers than
the signs. Of these Manilius will speak in 581-617.

No extant astrologer concurs with Manilius in the number of years allotted
by the signs, and few of them allow the signs so much importance in their
system. The earliest doctrine, so they tell us, was that of Petosiris and
NechepSO‚ who appointed as the utmost term of human life a number of
years equalling the number of equatorial degrees which accompanies‚ in a
given 1atitude, the rising of three signs or one quadrant of the zodiac.
Longevity therefore depended on the place of birth. The three signs Leo
Virgo Libra. (or Virgo Libra Scorpius) which are longest in rising were
supposed to rise in company with 111⁰ 40¹ of the equator in the latitude of
