ASTRONOMIGON III xxiii

to the next, and so forth. But we find that this is merely a means of
reckoning: dominion over the several divisions of time is allotted not to
the zodiacal signs themselves but to the planets whose houses they are.
Nearly the same system is set forth in Ptol. tetr. p. 54¹¹-. Firmicus, who
tells us at math. 1v ‘20 2 that he has treated the subject in sinyulari libro
quem de domino qenicurae et chronocratore ad Marinum nostrum scrip-simus,
expounds in 11 26-8 a system very unlike those of Manilius, Paulus, and
Ptolemy; but in the midst of it occur two sentences, 11 27 3-4, which
appear to be inconsistent with their context and borrowed from a source
nearer to Manilius: annum atatem facillimis rationibus inuenimus; nam ab
horoscopo semper sumit exordium, et primm annus erit, in quo est horoscopus
constitutus, secundus in secundo siquo, tertius in tercio, et sic ceteri per ordinem.

alii in diurna genitura a Sole hoc idem faciunt, in nocturna α Lumm et habet
rationem.

There is a clear allusion to the χρονοκρατορίσ. of the zodiacal signs in Pers.
v 45 sqq. non equidem hoc dubites, amborum foedere certo Ι consentire dies
ec ab ww sidere duci. 1 nostra uel aequali suspendii tempora Libra 1 Parca
tenax ueri etc. The language of Juvenal in vl 571 quis mensis damnis, quae
dentur tempora lucro, XII 62 sq. tempora . . . prospera aectoris satumque, xv1
4 faci . . . hora beniyni, leaves it uncertain whether his chronoci·ators are
signs or planets.

560-580 Now follows the chapter which the Greeks entitle περὶ

χρόνων ζωῆσ. Let us be certified how long we have to
live, and in the first place what measure of days we may expect
from the signs of the zodiac. They bestow shorter 0r longer
terms of life according as they are nearer to the vernal or the
autumnal equinox.

Aries and Pisces, each 10 years and 8 months.
Taurus and Aquarius, each 12 years and 8 months.
Gemini and Capricorn, each 14 years and 8 months.
Cancer ancl Sagittarius, each 16 years and 8 months.
Leo and Scorpius, each 18 years and 8 months.
Virgo and Libra, each 20 years and 8 months.

The number of years which each sign bestows is nearly propor-
tionate to the time which, according to the false opinion of Manilius
111 275-95, it occupies in rising at Alexandria. Aries, rising with
40 stadeS, bestows 10 years, 1 for each 4 stadia; Taurus, rising
with 48 stadia, bestows 12 years 3 Virgo, rising with 80, bestows 20.
Only the addition of 8 months in each case disturbs the proportion.

But Manilius seems to have obtained his figures by performing
an operation similar to that which he prescribes in 385-442 for
finding, in any latitude, the time occupied by each sign in rising.
As he then divided by 6 the hours of the longest day and gave
