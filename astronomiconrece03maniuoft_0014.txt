should proceed backward instead of forward. The inversion os
nature’s diurnal order which takes place at night is that the Sun
then resigns his primacy to the Moon. And to preclude all possi-
bility of mistake Manilius next translates his figurative language
into its literal equivalent: consu-Ze tum Phoeben imitantem lumina
fratris Ι semper et in proprio regnantem tempore noctis. That is all
that is meant by uerte uias.

So much is certain ε this is what Manilius sayS, and not only are his words
plain but their sense is consistent. There is less certainty about the meaning
of the Greek term, used by Nechepso and Petosiris, which Manilius is trans-
lating: ἀνάπαλιν. Vettius Valens p. 154 23-8 has these words: ἑν γὰρ τῇ
ιγ’ βίβλῳ ὁ βασιλεὺσ (Nechepso) . . . κλῆρον Τύχησ ἐπιφέρει ἀπὸ Ἠλίου καὶ
Σελήνησ καὶ ὡροσκόπου, περὶ οὗ καὶ αἴνιγμα τέθεικε τὸ ἔμπαλιν καὶ
ἀνάπαλιν. What Nechepso meant by ἔμπαλιν will not here concern us,
since it appears from Val. p. 59 25 and p. 332 33 that the term did not
indicate any peculiarity of the nocturnal method3 but in considering the
meaning of ἀνάπαλιν it will be convenient to begin with Ptolemy. Ptolemy
tetr. p. 33¹¹· ed. 1535 writes κλῆρον μέντοι Τύχησ συνάγομεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ
πάντοτε τῶν μοιρῶν καὶ ἡμέραιν καὶ νυκτὸσ τοῦ ἀπὸ Ἡλίου ἐπὶ Σελήνην,
καὶ τὰ ἴσα ἀφαιροῦμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου κατὰ τὰ ἑπόμενα τῶν ζῳδίων, and
again p. 45 τοῦ καλουμένου κλήρου τῆσ Τύχησ . . . καθ’ ὃν πάντοτε τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ
Ἡλίου ἐπὶ τὴν Σελήνην διάστασιν ἐκβάλλομεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὡροσκόπου καὶ ἐπὶ
τῶν τῆσ ὴμέρασ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τῆσ νυκτὸσ γεννωμένων. In thus using one
and the same calculation for diurnal and nocturnal genitures it seems that
Ptolemy was singulam and his scholiast tells us that his practice was due
to the interpretation which he put upon the ἀνάπαλιν of Nechepso and
Petosiris: ed. Basil. 1559 p. lll εἰδέναι γὰρ χρὴ ὡσ οὒ τὸν αὐτὸν τοῖσ ἄλλοισ
κλῆρον Τύχησ ὁ Πτολεμαΐοα- λαμβάνει ἀλλὰ. πάντοτε ἀπὸ Ἠλίου ἐπὶ Σελήνην
ἀριθμεῖ καὶ τὰ ἴσα ἀπὸ ὡροσκόπου. οὐ γὰρ, φησὶ (this statement is not extant>
in Ptolemy)‚ νενοήκασι τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ παλαιοῦ περὶ κλήρου Τύχησ· γεγραμμένα.
λέγει δὲ παλαιὸν τὸν Νεχεψὼ καὶ Πετόσιριν. οὗτοι γὰρ πρῶτοι τὸ δι’ άστρολογίασ·
ἐξήπλωσαν προγνωστικόν. τί οὖν ἔφασαν effron ὅταν κλῆρον Τύχησ λαμβάνῃσ,
ὴμέρασ μὲν ἀπὸ Ἠλίου ἐπὶ Σελήνην ἀρίθμει, καὶ τὰ ἴσα ἀπὸ ὡροσκόπου καὶ ἐπὶ
τὰ. ἑπόμενα τῶν ζῳδίων ἀπόλυε, νυκτὸσ δὲ τὸ ἀνάπαλιν. τὸ ἀνάπαλιν δὲ
τί ἐστιν; ‘tva άπὸ Σελήνησ- ἐπὶ ’Ἠλιον ποιήσῃσ, καὶ μηκέτι εἰσ τὰ
ἑπόμενα ἀλλ’ εἰσ τὸ. ἡγούμενα ἀπολύσῃσ. πάλιν γὰρ ὁ αὐτὸσ εὑρίσ-
κεται ὀ καὶ πρότερον εὑρεθεὶσ <ἀριθμὸσ>, ὀ ἁριθμηθεὶσ ἀπὸ Ἠλίου ἐπὶ Σελήνην.
οἱ δὲ ἐπιγενόμενοι οὐκέτι τὸ ἀνάπαλιν ἐπὶ πάντων ἐφύλαξαν, ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τῆσ
ἀριθμήσεωσ τῆσ ἀπὸ Σελήνηο· ἐπὶ ’Ἠλιον, οὐκέτι δὲ τὴν τάξιν τῶν ζῳδίων ἐπὶ τὸ
ἀνάπαλιν καὶ τὰ προηγούμενα ἐποιήσαντο. What Nechepso and Petosiris
themselves meant by their ἀνάπαλιν we cannot now determine ; but Ptolemy,
if we believe his scholiast, understood it as Pingre understands the uerte
uias of Manilius: in a nocturnal geniture not only was the counting of
degrees to start from the Moon instead of the Sun, but the measuring
off from the horoscope (though not the counting from the Moon) was
to be made backwards‚ Aries Pisces Aquarius and so on. Thus interpreted,
Nechepso and Petosiris incur the charge which Pingre levels at Manilius : that
their diurnal and nocturnal methods are in reality identical, and that the
pretence of giving two different rules is a mystifying waste of words. So
