with those degrees of 1116 equator. The point of the zodiac at which the number
ends will be the horoscope.

the given latitude)· τὸν ’γὰρ συναχθέντα ἀριθμὸν διεκβαλοῦμεν ἡμέρασ μὲν

510-559 We now come to that department of astrology which is-

called χρονοκρατορία or temporum dominium, and we are to
learn how the various divisions of time composing the life of man
are severally governed by celestial influences. Manilius impartially
expounds two systems, which cannot both be true.

By the one, 514-536, the first year of a man’s life falls under
that sign of the zodiac in which the Sun was situate at his birth,
the second under the next sign, and so on till the 12 818118 are ex-
hausted3 the 13⁰¹ year belongs to the same sign as the first, and
the 1111661 8068 round anew. The first month of his life belongs-
to 1116 81811 111 which the Moon was situate, the second to the next,
and so forward 3 the 13*h to the same as 1116 first. The first day of
his life belongs to 1116 81811 os: his horoscope, 1116 second to the next,
and all follows as before. The hours, like the days, start from
the sign of the horoscope, and revolve in the regular circle.

The other system, 537-559, 18 simpler: years months days and
hours all begin their circle with the sign of the horoscope, and the
13ὼ year month day or hour begins it again. But the consequences,
as a moment's thought will show, are no less complex.

No other astrologer that I know of thus ascribes dominion over the
temporal divisions of life to the signs of the zodiac. There is indeed in
Paul. Alex. Q a chapter περὶ ἐνιαυτοῦ καὶ μηνὸσ καὶ ὴμέρασ which has some
resemblance to Manil. 111 537-559. Paulus bids 118 allot the first year of
life to the sign of the horoscope, the second to the next sign, and the 13th
again to the sign of the horoscope, as in Manilius3 the first month to the
next sign ast-er the horoscope, the second to the next after that ; the first
day to the same sign as the second month and third year, the second day
