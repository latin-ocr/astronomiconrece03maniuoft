viii M. MAN ILII

But if the nativity 1811 by night, change your procedure accord-
ingly. Count the number 01 degrees, not from the Sun to the Moon,
but from the Moon to the Sun, and measure off this number, as
before, from the cardinal point 01 the horoscope: where it ends,
there is the sors Fortunae. Let the Sun be still in Cancer and the
Moon still in Virgo, but let the horoscope be now in Aries, so that
the Sun will be under the horizon. The Moon and Sun are 10 signs
apart: measure off 10 signs from Aries, and the sors Fortunae will

be found in Aquarius.

 

RATIO NOC'I'VRNA

The counting and the measurement, both by day and by night,
take place ἐπὶ τὰ ἑπόμενα, per signa consequentia, in the regular
order 01 the signs 01 the zodiac, from Aries through Taurus to Pisces,
not from Aries through Pisces to Taurus. This is necessarily to be

presumed, because Manilius says nothing to the contrary ; and so the
passage was rightly understood by Fayus. The meaning of uerte uias

in verse 196 is muta rationem, take the Moon instead 01 the Sun as
your starting point.

But Scaliger chooses to interpret the phrase otherwise, as 11 it
meant numera retro. I shall presently show that it cannot; but
even 11 it did it would make no difference. In the nocturnal geniture
given above we should then get 2 signs’ distance by counting back-
ward from the Moon in Virgo to the Sun in Cancer ; and by measuring
this distance backward from the horoscope in Aries we should find
